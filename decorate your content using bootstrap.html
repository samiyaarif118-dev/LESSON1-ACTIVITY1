            <h1>Gardening</h1> is the practice of growing and caring for
            plants, flowers, and vegetables in
            home gardens and <mark>outdoor spaces</mark> to enhance
            beauty and sustainability. At
            the centre of gardening is a
            <pre>well-prepared soil bed</pre> with
            proper nutrients and
            moisture, each garden comprising healthy roots supported
            by<code> water and sunlight</code>. The gardener improves
            growth by planting seeds and tending plants with the
            right tools, while the <abbr>maintenance and care</abbr> side
            tries to protect plants and<blockquote>
                nurture</blockquote> them to maturity.
