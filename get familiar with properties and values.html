        Web development is the work involved in developing a web site for the Internet or an intranet.
        Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex
        web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services.
        A more comprehensive list of tasks to which web development commonly refers, may include web engineering,
        web design, web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, web server
        and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.
